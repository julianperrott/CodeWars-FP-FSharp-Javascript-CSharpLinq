## **Codewars Kata practice** ##

http://www.codewars.com/ is a site where code kata can be practised in a variety of languages.

Kata are real code challenges focused on improving skill and technique. Some train programming fundamentals, while others focus on complex problem solving. Each kata is crafted for and by the community.

## CodeWars-FP-FSharp-Javascript-CSharpLinq ##

This project holds the Kata I have worked on.

There are 3 projects in which I solve the same kata:

* FSharp - F#
* Javascript
* CSharp - C#

With the following goals:

1. - Learn F# by practicing the fundamentals.
1. - Apply the functional programming approach from F# into C# (Linq) and Javascript (Array).
1. - Improve my functional programming skills in all 3 languages.
1. - Once the kata is solved in F# use it as a starting point to solve the problem in Haskell.
